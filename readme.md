# Response Timer
A Docker image to help you get a nicely formatted result for the response time of a website or API. ‚è≤

## Why?
[I write a lot of technical blog posts](https://www.karllhughes.com/writing/), and I often want to compare the response times of different hosting providers from various locations around the world. I sometimes use [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/) for these tests, but it doesn't support request bodies, headers, or different methods (POST, PUT, etc.). Plus, they throttle your usage, so it's not great if you want to run a lot of tests.

After searching for how I could accomplish this with curl, I found [this answer on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22625150/977192). This was good, but I wanted to simplify it and put it in a ready-to-deploy Docker image so I could quickly run it on any host that will run a container. üê≥

The goal of this project is to be able to quickly run the script from several nodes (and my local machine) to determine how quickly the API or website will respond from each of them.

## Local Usage

Pull the latest version from Docker Hub: 

```bash
docker pull draftdev/rt
```

A simple GET request:

```bash
docker run --rm draftdev/rt jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
# Response
          final_url:  http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
      response_code:  200s
    time_namelookup:  0.025098s
       time_connect:  0.042070s
    time_appconnect:  0.000000s
   time_pretransfer:  0.042265s
      time_redirect:  0.000000s
 time_starttransfer:  0.091801s
                    ----------
         time_total:  0.098020s
```

A more complex POST request (you can use [any of the args that curl supports](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html)): 

```bash
docker run --rm draftdev/rt jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"title": "Another great post"}' -X POST
# Response
          final_url:  http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
      response_code:  201s
    time_namelookup:  0.014518s
       time_connect:  0.029930s
    time_appconnect:  0.000000s
   time_pretransfer:  0.029982s
      time_redirect:  0.000000s
 time_starttransfer:  0.143273s
                    ----------
         time_total:  0.143517s
```

## Deploying to Various Hosting Providers

### DigitalOcean

![hosting-do.png]

- Log in and [create a new Droplet](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new).
- Select the Docker Marketplace image
- Select the smallest ($5/mo) droplet
- Select a single region
- Add your SSH key
- Hit deploy

Once deployed, you can run this container via SSH:

```bash
ssh root@<YOUR_DROPLET_IP> "docker run --rm draftdev/rt jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"title\": \"Another great post\"}' -X POST"
# Response
          final_url:  http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
      response_code:  201s
    time_namelookup:  0.001051s
       time_connect:  0.004071s
    time_appconnect:  0.000000s
   time_pretransfer:  0.004155s
      time_redirect:  0.000000s
 time_starttransfer:  0.046294s
                    ----------
         time_total:  0.046395s
```

Repeat the droplet creation process in each region you want to test your app from, or [migrate the droplet using a snapshot](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/snapshots/how-to/migrate-droplets/).

### Fly.io
Coming soon.

### AWS Lambda
Coming soon.

## Contributing
Improvements are welcome, but please use the [Issues](https://github.com/draftdev/response-timer/issues) to discuss them first. This is a simple script, so I don't envision bundling much more functionality into it.
